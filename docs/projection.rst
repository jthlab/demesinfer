Random Projection

This page demonstrates the entire constrained optimization workflow with ``momi3``. It stands on its own, separate from the main tutorial.

This tutorial shows how to create a customizable SciPy optimizer for any demographic model using ``scipy.minimize``. It is *not* a primer on numerical optimization. SciPy's API/behaviour can change across
versions — **We are not responsible for any updates/errors made to scipy.minimize.**
